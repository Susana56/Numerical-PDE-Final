# Numerical-PDE-Final
This is my Research Project for Numerical PDE course. 

This research project was exploring finite difference methods for solving Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations. All the methods coded in this project
along with the research comes from *Robust Numerical methods for Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations* [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-34467-4]

Here is my research paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hDCS-4boVgrWYgzex-VGz7FImjeUEie-/view?usp=sharing
